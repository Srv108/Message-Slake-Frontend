The WebRTC standard covers two different technologies: 
    media capture devices 
    peer-to-peer connectivity.

navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia() to capture MediaStreams
For screen recording, we use navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia().
The peer-to-peer connectivity is handled by the RTCPeerConnection interface
